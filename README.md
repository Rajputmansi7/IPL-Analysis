# IPL-Analysis

## Problem Statement:
"Business Basics" is a business blogging company that has established a strong
following in the business content space. Considering the negative sentiment from
viewers on the fact that more than 50% of the IPL advertisements are occupied by fantasy
apps and pan masala ads, they want to release an edition focusing on the dual impact of
IPL 2025: its massive economic footprint and its potential social/health implications.
This magazine aims to provide a balanced analysis of how IPL drives economic growth
while also examining the potential consequences of certain advertising practices during
the tournament.
The chief editor Tony Sharma oversees this publication and believes that a
comprehensive understanding of IPL's impact requires looking beyond just cricket
statistics to the business ecosystem and social responsibility aspects. He has reached
out to Peter Pandey, a journalist in his team who specializes in business analytics. Peter
has received preliminary unstructured data scraped by using tools like perplexity.
